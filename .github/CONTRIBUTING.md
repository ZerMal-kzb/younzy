# Contributing to Younzy
> First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

We love the contributors because they make this project come alive and even better with their unique talent and skills.
If you want to contribute, you should at least know the basics of the following:

- JavaScript (With NodeJS)
- Discord.JS (NPM module to communicate with the Discord API)
- Knowledge of using Git

If you don't know all of this, you can always contribute to simpler files such as this document, the README or other files that don't require knowledge.

If you don't want to contribute code, you can always [open a problem](https://github.com/younzy/younzy/issues/new) and share your ideas or report bugs.

If you have a question, please ask it on the [Younzy Discord](https://discord.gg/WQC3QGD).
